Summary: CS4518 Tutorial ARCore

## This Project
This project includes two Unity asset bundles, CS4518 and CompletedScenes. CS4518 contains the Unity ARCore SDK as well as some starting prefabs to complete the tutorial. 
CompletedScenes includes all files in CS4518, but also a finished scene ready to build to a device. The Android Studio exported code from Unity is included in this project as well.

As this project is Unity-based, there is not much coding required for this tutorial.

The team discussed the use of Unity previously with the Professor and was given approval. Finally, a finished APK with its associated images are included in the submission. 

This APK will work on devices with Android 7.0 and higher. Launch the application and hold your device over the image of the WPI logo (make sure this logo fits within the brackets displayed on the screen). 

A gold cube should appear, and if you step back, a spinning gold cube should be floating anchored in space.
