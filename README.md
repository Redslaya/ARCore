summary: CS4518 Tutorial: ARCore

## Tihs Project
This project includes a few items, namely two unity asset bundles, CS4518 and CompletedScenes. CS4518 contains the Unity ARCore SDK as well as some starting prefabs to complete the tutorial. 
CompeletedScenes contains everything CS4518 has, but also a finished scene ready to build to a device. As this project is unity based there is not much to view codewise. We have also included the android studio exported code
from unity, however there is not much to see there as it is all generated through the unity program. The team discussed the use of unity previously with the professor and was given approval. Finally there is a finished APK and image 
in the submission. this APK will work on phones with android 7.0 and higher. launch the application and fit the image of the WPI logo in the brackets. a gold cube should appear and if you step back a spinning gold cube should be floating
anchored in space.
